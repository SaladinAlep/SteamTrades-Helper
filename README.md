# SteamTrades Helper
Message notifications for SteamTrades.com

This is a browser extension that provides the message notifications function of my [PySteamTrades](https://github.com/SaladinAlep/PySteamTrades) script.

It runs in the background, checks the URL https://www.steamtrades.com/messages every 5 minutes and displays a desktop notification for new messages.

You can add it to Firefox at:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/steamtrades-helper/
